BGU-SPAD: Skin stretch Perception and Action Dataset and code

This repository contains all the data and code used in the manuscript titled "Can Information About Stiffness Perception be Inferred
from Action Signals Using Models?", published in eNeuro.

There are two folders, one with the data and one with the code. Each contains a file with further explanations regarding the folder's contents.

 Note - the Psignifit toolbox 2.5.6 (Wichmann, F. and Hill, N. (2001). The psychometric function: I. Fitting, sampling, and goodness of fit.
973 Perception & Psychophysics, 63(8):1293â€“1313. ISBN: 0031-5117) was used. The codes in the Psignifit folder are not our custom codes, rather those of the toolbox.
