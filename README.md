# Exploring-Perception-and-Action
This repository contains all the data and code used in the manuscript titled "Exploring the Relation Between Stiffness Perception and Action Using Models and Artificial Neural Networks".

There are two folders, one with the data and one with the code. Each contains a file with further explanations regarding the folder's contents.

 Note - the Psignifit toolbox 2.5.6 (Wichmann, F. and Hill, N. (2001). The psychometric function: I. Fitting, sampling, and goodness of fit.
973 Perception & Psychophysics, 63(8):1293â€“1313. ISBN: 0031-5117) was used. The codes in the Psignifit folder are not our custom codes, rather those of the toolbox.
