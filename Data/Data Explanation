Two formats of the data have been uploaded:
1. Participants' original data - this is the data that was recorded during the stiffness discrimination experiment. 
   Each participant has a MATLAB data file, and is opened as a cell array in MATLAB. Each cell in the array is a structure containing the data from one trial.
   The data included:
   a. The signals recorded during the interactions with each the comparison (DataComp) and standard (DataRef) virutal objects. 
      - Column 1: time.
      - Columns 2 - 5: position.
      - Columns 6 - 9: velocity.
      - Columns 10 - 13: grip force.
      - Columns 14 - 15: commanded and recorded movements of the tactors.
   b. The values of the comparison and standard stiffness levels (CompStiffnessVal and RefStiffnessVal).
   c. Gain - the tactor displacement gain.
   d. Answer - which virtual object the participant perceived as stiffer ('Comp' for comparison and 'Ref' for standard).

2. The data following all the preprocessing - as was inputted into the artificial neural networks.
