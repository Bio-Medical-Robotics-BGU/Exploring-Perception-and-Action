The included codes are as follows, in the order in which they run:

1. Preprocessing (MATLAB code) - takes the participant data and performs the preprocessing described in the manuscript. 
2. ModelFeatureExtraction (MATLAB code) - takes the participant data and computes the features for the models. 
3. Create10Folds (Python code) - splits the participants into training and test data for each of the 10 folds in the k-fold validation. 
4. CreateDatasetsForEachFold (Python code) - creates the training and test datasets for each fold based on the division in the "Create10Folds" code.
